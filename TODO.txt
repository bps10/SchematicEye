1
- Iterative solve for best diopter accommodation of lens.
- Add spectacle lens option - introduce chromatic analysis.
    + can define wavelengths in Goptical: add_spectral_line.
    + need to figure out how to create a lens with specific wavelength pass.
    + take mean of wavelengths during analysis.
2
- create a comprehensive analysis option - schematic, aberrations, psf, etc.
3
- Work out GRIN model.
- Allow sagittal and tang MTFs by specifying geometry of ray tracer dist.
4
- Off axis - change location of point source for marginal rays.
- GUI - web based. Big issue is getting everything installed on AWS.
- add verbose option and single letter options (e.g. -h = help)
